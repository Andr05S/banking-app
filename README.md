# banking-app
This is my first banking app coded in java.  The UI is fairly barebones, but the project is functional.
You can login, create a new user, open new accounts, make deposits and withdrawals to existing accounts.
It also has checks in place to prevent you from creating an already existing username.  It will also verify your username to its specific password using a hashmap.
The files for all data are stored as CSV's which are accessed as needed.
